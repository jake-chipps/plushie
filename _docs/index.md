## Overview
This DIY-style curriculum uses design to introduce physical computing. In this project, learners will: design an aesthetic layout for a plushie; design and construct a circuit on the plushie using conductive thread; program independent LEDs in the circuit; program music initiated by user interaction, and; program an animation using an LED matrix.

## Easily Integrated into Formal Educational Environments
This project can be integrated into any educator's classroom starting at fourth grade. Due to the highly personalized nature of the project, students can insert their interests and identities in order to communicate their understanding of standards-based content.

It is highly advised that educators create a project of their own first in order to understand the content as well as be able to troubleshoot any issues that arise with learners. Additionally, educators will need to consider pedagogy in order to scaffold the content for their unique learners.
