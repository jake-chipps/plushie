## Objectives
- Design and construct a computational artifact.
- Use a sensor to collect data from diverse users and develop models.

## Computer Science Standards
- *CS.AP.6-8.6* seek and incorporate feedback from team members and users to refine a solution that meets user needs.
- *CS.AP.6-8.8* systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases.
- *CS.CS.6-8.2* design projects that combine hardware and software components to collect and exchange data.
- *CS.CS.6-8.3* systematically identify and fix problems with computing devices and their components.
- *CS.IC.6-8.3* collaborate with other contributors when creating a computational artifact.
