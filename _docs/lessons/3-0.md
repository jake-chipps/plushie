## Objectives
- Use conditionals to implement decision-making in code.
- Use loops to iterate through NeoPixel values.
- Use RGB values creatively to represent computational data.

## Computer Science Standards
- *CS.AP.6-8.3* develop programs that combine control structures, including nested loops and compound conditionals.
- *CS.DA.6-8.1* collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable.
- *CS.DA.6-8.2* represent data using multiple formats.

## Materials
The following materials are required for this lesson:
- 1 Computer with Arduino IDE downloaded
- Friend-O-Meter project (so far)
- 5 alligator clips
- 1 USB to microUSB

## Vocabulary
The following are terms used in this activity.

 Term | Definition
 ---: | --
**Boolean**  |  a binary variable, having two possible values called *true* and *false*.
**Conditional**  |  instructs the computer on the decision to make when given some conditions.
**RGB**  |  an additive color model in which the red, green, and blue primary colors of light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.
**Loop**  |  a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met.
**Index**  | an integer used to point at a data element within an array.
