## Buzzer
There is a **buzzer** on the back of the Micro:Bit.

A buzzer is an electronic device on a circuit that creates a buzzing sound via oscillating frequencies. In essence, we can play musical tones by changing the frequency of the oscillations. To create music for our project, we are going to utilize the buzzer.

## Frequency and Duration
A note is a sound that is defined by a certain pitch (**frequency**), and we play the note for a certain time interval (**duration**). In order to code music, there are two concepts that we need to be able to code: frequency and duration. We will explore both of these concepts here.

### Frequency
In Western music, we use 12 semitones on a chromatic scale. If you were to look at a piano, each piano key is a different note. The white keys are the notes **C**, **D**, **E**, **F**, **G**, **A**, **B**, and the black keys are sharps **#** (a half tone above the white key to the left) and flats **b** (a half tone below the white key to the right). Groups of notes from C to B are defined as an octave.

All Western music uses these notes in some combination. In sheet music, we use staffs to visualize individual notes. Each line and space on the staff represents a different note.

Let's turn to durations so that we can start looking at how to read music.

### Duration
In sheet music, we have symbols that represent how long to play each note. We represent note lengths in terms of **whole**, **half**, **quarter**, and **eighth** notes.

A whole note is sustained for the longest amount of time. There are two half notes for every whole note. There are two quarter notes for every half note, and there are 2 eighth notes for every quarter note.

### Coding Music
You can find all blocks to make music in the *Music* menu within the **Code Library** panel. First is the *play melody* block:

![play melody block](../images/melody-library.png)

This block allows you to create a melody using a visual block-based interface. You can also choose a pre-made melody from the *Gallery*.

Second is the *Play Tone* block:

To use this block, you need the frequency of the note you want to play as well as the duration of the note. 

For example, if we wanted to play *The Alphabet Song*, stopping at the letter P, then the list of notes with their durations might look like this:

A | Middle C | Quarter | 1
B | Middle C | Quarter | 1
C | Middle G | Quarter | 1
D | Middle G | Quarter | 1
E | Middle A | Quarter | 1
F | Middle A | Quarter | 1
G | Middle G | Half | 2
H | Middle F | Quarter | 1
I | Middle F | Quarter | 1
J | Middle E | Quarter | 1
K | Middle E | Quarter | 1
L | Middle D | Eighth | 1/2
M | Middle D | Eighth | 1/2
N | Middle D | Eighth | 1/2
O | Middle D | Eighth | 1/2
P | Middle C | Half | 2
