## Finish the Plushie
At this point, we have a piece of felt with the Micro:Bit and LEDs sewn using conductive thread. The LEDs make a fun pattern, and on user input, our project plays music. We are now ready to turn the project into a plushie toy. 

![The project so far](../images/after-coding.gif)

To start, lay the front panel on top of the back panel of felt. Using a **blanket stitch**, sew the edges of the front and back panels together and stop when you have a small gap in which you can stuff the plushie with fluffy stuffing.
