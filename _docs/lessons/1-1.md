## Aesthetic Design
Decide what shape you would like for your plushie. In this example, I used a rectanguler shape in order to create a scenic view of a hike I frequent in Montana. The shape of your plushie can be anything you like, but some shapes will be more difficult to cut and sew the edges to make the final plushie than others. 

Cut out two pieces of felt for your shape. The two pieces of felt will serve as the front panel and back panel of your plushie. You can set the back panel aside for the end when we finally sew the plushie together. For now, we will just work with the front panel of the plushie.

On the front panel, use the fabric markers to create a design. You can use embroidery thread at this point to make your design even more visually stunning. As you are designing, think about where you are going to put the Micro:Bit and your LEDs. Plan everything out. For example, here is how I planned the location of my components.

In my design, I envision the blue LEDs in the river having a flowing pattern, showing the water coming downstream. I want the LED on the flower to always be on, and the LED matrix on the Micro:Bit is going to show a glowing sun. I set my components where I want them and took a picture so that I can use the picture to create my circuit diagram.

## Circuit Design
A circuit diagram is a way to visually communicate how to construct a circuit. When I am sewing my lines, I do not want to have to also think about the circuit - planning out the circuit ahead of time gives me the ability to focus on the sewing and decreases the chances of making a mistake. Before we talk about how to make a circuit diagram, let's take a look at what happens in a simple circuit.

### Circuits: What You Need To Know
Consider a light (here an **LED**) connected to a battery, as shown below.

To turn an LED on, you need a **power source** (e.g. battery) and a way to connect the battery to the light. Both the light and the battery have two poles - a positive connector and a negative connector. Electrical current flows out of the positive side of the power source and through the LED. As the current passes through the LED, it lights up. The current then goes out the negative side of the LED and back to the power source where it gets re-energized, and makes the trip again. The concept of current flowing in one direction from the positive pole to the negative pole of a power source is called **polarity**. 

For your construction, the important thing to note here is that positive on the power source is connected to positive on the LED, and negative on the power source is connected to negative on the LED. <span class="important">Many times, when everything is sewn and an LED does not turn on, it is because you have <b>reversed the polarity</b>. In other words, the positive on the power source is connected to the negative on the LED and vice versa. To fix this, simply turn the LED around and resew.</span>

Current has to flow from the power source to the LED through **conductive** material in a **loop** or a complete cycle. In this project, we will be using thread made of steel, or **conductive thread** to act as the vehicle for how the current can pass from the power source to the LEDs.

<span class="think">In the image above of a simple circuit, how might you add a way to turn the light on and off?</span>

<span class="solution">A circuit needs to be a complete loop to power on an LED. By disconnecting one side of the circuit, the current would stop flowing. By finding a way to reattach the connection, one can add a way to turn the LED on and off.</span>

### Computational Circuits
Turning on a single LED with a power source requires a complete loop with a positive side and a negative side. But what if we want to have multiple LEDs that behave in different ways? For that, we need a **microcontroller**.
