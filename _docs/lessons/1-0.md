 Term | Definition
 ---: | --
**Circuit**  |  composed of individual electronic components, such as LEDs, connected by conductive material (copper tape or conductive thread) which electric current can flow through.
**Current**  |  a flow of positive electric charge.
**Conductor**  |  materials that allow the flow of electric current.
**Insulator**  |  materials that block the flow of electric current.
**Load**  | any component in an electrical circuit that consumes power or energy.
**LED**  |  an example of a load; a device that emits light when an electric current passes through it.
**Polarity**  |  current flows in one direction from the positive pole to the negative pole of a power source in our circuits.
**Circuit Diagram**  |  a way to visualize and communicate circuits to others.
**Microcontroller**  |  a small computer on a single chip that stores a single program. The MicroBit is an example of a microcontroller.
