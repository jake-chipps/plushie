## Set Up The Programming Environment
- Open [MakeCode for Micro:Bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/).
- Click **New Project** in order to open a new project.
- Plug in the MicroUSB to the Micro:Bit and the USB to your computer.
- Give your project a name (I called mine Plushie), and click **Create**.
- Click the gear in the upper right corner.
- Click **Connect device**.
- Choose the device that appears in the window, and click **Connect**.

You can now download your program into the Micro:Bit.

## Understanding MakeCode
You will notice that in the program, you have already been given two blocks: **on start** and **forever**.

 Block | What It Does
 ---: | --
**on start** | all code in this block will run when the Micro:Bit first turns on. This is where we initialize everything before anything happens.
**forever** | all code in this block will loop forever. This is where we write the bulk of our code.

While we generally only have one **on start** block, we can have as many **forever** blocks as we want. When we run multiple **forever** blocks, the code will run **in parallel**, meaning that the codes in the two blocks will happen simultaneously. For example, if I want to both walk and chew gum at the same time, I could write:

![example of parallel programming](../images/parallel.png)

Here, both forever loops will run at the same time. So I will call my *walk* function as well as my *chew gum* function at the same time.

### The Three Panels
The MakeCode programming environment can be broken down into three distinct panels: **simulator**, **code menu**, and **coding environment**.

![three panels in MakeCode](../images/makecode.png)

 Panel | What It Is For
 ---: | --
 **Simulator**  | This will simulate what will happen on the Micro:Bit when the code is run. Press the **play** button to run a simulation of your code before you download it to the device to ensure it works as intended.
 **Code Menu**  | This is the library of code you can use. Each option is a menu with further blocks you can use in your code, organized by what the code does.
 **Coding Environment**  | This is where you write your code. Simply drag and drop blocks from the code menu into the coding environment in order to use them in your program. Blocks must be attached! All blocks must be inside the **on start** block, the **forever** block, any of the blocks from the **Input** menu, or a **function**. 

 ## Test Your LEDs
 Here we will assume that you have used pins *0*, *1*, and *2*. If you have not, then change your code appropriately. If you sewed to the *3V* pin, you will notice that this LED is already on. This is because the *3V* pin sends a constant current and cannot be changed; however, the LEDs connected to pins *0*, *1*, and *2* are not currently on because we have not instructed those pins to send current through the circuit. We will do that now. 

 - Click *Advanced* and then click *Pins* in the **Code Menu**. 
 - Drag **digital write pin ___ to ___** to the **Coding Environment** three times and move them into the **forever block** as show.

![turn on the leds](../images/turn-on-leds.png)

In the block, the pin name *P0*, *P1*, and *P2* refer to pins *0*, *1*, and *2* respectively. Next let's take a look at what we are setting the pin value to: *0* or *1*. *0* means that we are closing the gate and cutting off the current. *1* means that we are opening the gate and current is allowed to go through. Essentially, *0* means *off* and *1* means *on*.

Click **Download** in the **Simulator** panel, and your LEDs should now be on. If not, check your **polarity** and make sure that your lines are not overlapping.
