## Overview
Before engaging in this section, you should be familiar with:
- Parallel and computational circuits
- Coding a light pattern using the Arduino language
- Functions

If you skipped these concepts, go back to [Circuits](../1-0/) and go through that section.

In this section, we will build the base of the *Friend-O-Meter* by:
- drawing the aesthetic design
- incorporating touch sensors to the aesthetic design
- adding a circuit diagram
- testing the LEDs
- creating a light pattern for the LEDs
- playing with the touch sensors

This project will be your own design, and you will make choices along the way. We will provide an example of our own as guidance, but your project may and should look different. Your decisions will lead to computational challenges that you will need to problem solve. For this reason, this guide will detail the decisions we made and how those decisions impact the coding.

## Aesthetic Design
We will continue to add functionality to the *Friend-O-Meter* beyond this section such as NeoPixels to note the friendship level, music, and a reset button.

For the purpose of creating the aesthetic design, you will create a friendship tester using two pieces of aluminum foil. Two or more people will hold hands, and two different individuals will touch one of the sensors to complete the circuit. The aluminum foil can be any size you want; however, the larger the foil, the greater range you will get when testing, which will affect your coding. The two foils can be placed anywhere on the card stock, but they cannot touch. Additionally, you do not want the copper tape going to your LEDs to touch the aluminum foil. You will add at most six LEDs and create a light pattern to make your design look spectacular.

For now, do not worry about the circuit. Just draw your imagery for the project, and note where you want your LEDs and touch sensors to go.

For our project, we made the following aesthetic design.

## Circuit Design
Now that we have placed the sensors and LEDs on the card stock, we need to make some decisions.
1. Will any of your LEDs be in parallel, or will they all be connected to different pins? You will need to think about what you want your LEDs to do and decide how you can make your intentions happen.
2. Where will you connect the Circuit Playground? When we did the [Simple Circuit](../1-1/) and [Parallel Circuit](../1-2/), we connected at the bottom of the project. This is your project so you can make this decision yourself.

For this, you will need:
- 1 Circuit Playground Classic
- <= 6 LEDs
- 2 Pieces aluminum foil cut into whatever shape you want
- Copper tape
- <= 7 Alligator clips
- Card stock
- USB to microUSB
- [Optional] 1/8" hole puncher
- [Optional] Tracing paper

*[Optional] If you do not want to write your circuit diagram directly on your aesthetic design, use the tracing paper. When tracing paper is stacked on your design, you will see your circuit diagram on top of your image, and there is no possibility of making an error and ruining your design.*

*[Optional] You can also write the circuit diagram on the back of the design. If you do this, you will want to poke holes using the 1/8" hole puncher in the card stock so that your LEDs can poke through to the front of your project. This may be a great way to hide your circuit.*

### LEDs
The LEDs can be connected to any of the digital out pins. The digital out pins are: **3**, **2**, **0**, **1**, **12**, **6**, **9**, **10**.

First, we drew the positive lines of the LEDs.

![positive lines](../images/2-1_positive-lines.png)

Since we only need one ground, we drew a path from the negative pole of each LED in a single ground line, as shown. Starting with the positive lines made this process easier. We decided to make every two LEDs in parallel because we wanted to have three sets of two LEDs. We also wanted fewer positive lines going down to ensure that there was no possibility of lines touching other lines, which could connect affect the outcome. <span class="important">If you are going to put LEDs in parallel, make sure that you choose the same color LED for the LEDs in parallel. It costs different amount of energy for current to flow through different colored LEDs, and current will always choose the "cheapest" path - meaning that both LEDs will not light up.</span>

### Touch Sensors
There are two touch sensors; one will act as ground, and the other will be programmed as an analog input. We will discuss what analog in means at the end of this section. One of the touch sensors will connect to **GND** and the other will connect to one of the analog input pins. The analog input pins are named slightly differently than the digital output pins. The table below shows the four pins that can handle analog input and their analog names (yes, when we use analog input pins, they are named differently and we need to use their analog names when we code them).

Digital Output Pin # | Analog Input Pin #
------------------:  | :-----------------
10  | A10
9  | A9
6  | A7
12  | A11
  |  

![analog input pins](../images/2-1_analog-inputs.png)

For our circuit diagram, we chose to connect the positive sensor to pin **10**, which when programmed as an analog input is actually pin **A10**. We connected the negative sensor pole to the same ground as we made for the LEDs earlier. At the base of each line, we wrote which pin to connect the line to. This will help us remember everything moving forward.
