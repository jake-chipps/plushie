## Set Up The Programming Environment
- Open [MakeCode for Micro:Bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/).
- Click **New Project** in order to open a new project.
- Plug in the MicroUSB to the Micro:Bit and the USB to your computer.
- Give your project a name (I called mine Plushie), and click **Create**.
- Click the gear in the upper right corner.
- Click **Connect device**.
- Choose the device that appears in the window, and click **Connect**.

You can now download your program into the Micro:Bit.

## Understanding MakeCode
You will notice that in the program, you have already been given two blocks: **on start** and **forever**.

 Block | What It Does
 ---: | --
**on start** | all code in this block will run when the Micro:Bit first turns on. This is where we initialize everything before anything happens.
**forever** | all code in this block will loop forever. This is where we write the bulk of our code.

While we generally only have one **on start** block, we can have as many **forever** blocks as we want. When we run multiple **forever** blocks, the code will run **in parallel**, meaning that the codes in the two blocks will happen simultaneously. For example, if I want to both walk and chew gum at the same time, I could write:

![example of parallel programming](../images/parallel.png)

Here, both forever loops will run at the same time. So I will call my *walk* function as well as my *chew gum* function at the same time.
