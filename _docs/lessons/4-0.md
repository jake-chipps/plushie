## Objectives
- Add reset functionality using conditionals and digital sensors.
- Use arrays to store and iterate through sound frequencies and delays to create music.

## Computer Science Standards
- *CS.AP.6-8.4* decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.
- *CS.CS.6-8.1* recommend improvements to the design of computing devices, based on an analysis of how users interact with the devices.

## Materials
The following materials are required for this lesson:
- 1 Computer with Arduino IDE downloaded
- Friend-O-Meter project (so far)
- 5 alligator clips
- 1 USB to microUSB
