              <p class="lead">This DIY guide is a step-by-step process for
              creating plushie with LEDs that display a light pattern and
              plays a musical melody. No programming experience or sewing experience
              required before starting this project. Anyone age 8 and older
              can create this project.</p>

            <p>This is a single project that enables the user to construct of a
              computational artifact based on their designs. Bringing together makerspaces
              and constructionism, this DIY project grounds learning of computer science and engineering
              in active, hands-on learning.

            <h3 class="text-center">For Everyone</h3>
            <p>This curiculum is a step-by-step process in creating circuits
              using a microcontroller and developing computational artifacts using
              input and output devices. This is a great place to start if you
              have never worked with computing systems or circuitry before. But
              even those familiar with circuits and programming circuits may still find value in this project.
              The goal is to be able to create your own projects after completing
              this project.
